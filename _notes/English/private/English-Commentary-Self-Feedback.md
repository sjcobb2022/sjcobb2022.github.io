# Commentary Thoughts

## Process: 
 - Start of with basic ideas in my head
 - Jot down ideas into mind map or outline or something similar
 - Expound on ideas in mind map and connect areas together
 - Write 1 or 2 complete sentences that I think will work well in the context
 - improvise a lot of the rest of it.


## Challenges
 - Order
	 - I think order is a majority of the struggle for me, as I struggle to find a good place to start and struggle to connect ideas well.
 - Trimming / selecting good points
	 - I try to put too much in some my commentaries. I should focus on only selecting the best points/arguments and dedicating more of my focus towards them.


## Action Plan
 - I guess the best thing that I could do to improve my commentaries would be to practice. 
	 - I really appreciate these short-form commentaries like the one we just did, as it helps me a lot.
