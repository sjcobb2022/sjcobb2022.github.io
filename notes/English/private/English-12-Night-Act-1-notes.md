	 - Why would the death of Olivia's brother cause her to go into a state of mourning for 7 years
	 	- she lost the male figures in her life
		- a way to reject her lovers (ORSINO)


Why was Orsino persistent in the pursuit of Olivias heat and hand in marriage despite knowing the she won't love him back
	 - She represented the idealised women for Orsino that he wanted to conquer
	 - He is a self indulgent prick

Orsino has a hunger for power and he is not satisfied and Orsino wants to conquer her not for her money or power but for the sake of conquering her.
