HR as a process is not just the responsibility of the department, it is also the responsibility of the managers / higher ups

third stage of HR is appraisal which occurs when the performance of the employee is reviewed

different from inspection which is typically a one way judgment of an employee's performance based observation

under a system of appraisal, employees may respond to or even initiate discussion, communication is 2 way and managers include constructive feedback

should be non-threatening, non-judgmental, and supportive process

GOOD:
