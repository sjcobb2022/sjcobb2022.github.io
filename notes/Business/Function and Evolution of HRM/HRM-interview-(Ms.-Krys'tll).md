whats in it for me

make sure they understand what they are learning. 
how can it be applied
how can the person use it


training b4 promotion most of the time
equip with the skills for the future of the career


can you just say no?
	 - employees dont actually resent training
	 - its can be time to relax/not work as much


not being stagnant
	 

surprising topic to be trained on
	 - diversity and inclusion
	 - come as you are but come as your best self


if its not a benchmark, you can't measure
	  - should measure level so that 
	  - certain level of performance that must be reached


soft skills and hard skills
 - soft skills are hard to teach. can't teach someone responsibility/ownership etc.
 - there are different teams for eh creating the curriculum
	 - instructional design team
		 - makes the curriculum


trainers are facilitators of knowledge

q:

do you need experience in the workforce beforehand to train 
	 - dont need experience, just need people skills and the ability to train
	 - can just go straight into it.

is the ability to train a talent or is it something that can be developed
