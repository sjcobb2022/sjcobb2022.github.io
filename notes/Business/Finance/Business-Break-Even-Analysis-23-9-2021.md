# Break Even Analysis

<br/>

## What is break even?

The point at which a business is not making a profit nor a loss.

Total amount of sails a business needs to cover their costs.

<br/>
<br/>

## Contribution

Contribution refers to the sum of money that remains after all direct and variable costs that have been take away from the sales revenue. i.e. the amount available to contribute towards paying fixed costs of production.

<br/>

| type                  | equation                                   |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Contribution per unit | $$Price - AverageCost$$                    |
| Total Contribution    | $$(Price - AverageCost) \times Quantity $$ |
| Gross Profit          | $$Total Contribution - TotalFixedCost$$    |

<br/>

$$\frac{Fixed}{Price - Variable}$$


<br/>
<br/>

## Increasing Profit

**Profits can be increase in the following cases**
- Increasing sales of the product which raises the total contribution
 - Reducing variable costs, perhaps through negotiating better deals with current suppliers
 - Reducing fixed costs and overheads, perhaps through better financial control.

<br/>
<br/>


## Contribution Analysis

understanding which products contribute the most towards the business.

**Contribution analysis has several uses**
- Pricing strategy
 - Product portfolio management
 - Make-or-but decisions
	 - Whether to make your own or buy from an external source
 - Special order decisions
	 - Are the items too expensive?
 - Break-even analysis

## Break even Analysis cont.

A business can only survive in the long term if its revenues exceed its costs i.e. if it is profitable

Business breaks even when neither a profit or loss is made

<br/>

### Loss
When the costs of a business exceed the revenues of the business.

<br/>

### Break Even

When the revenues are equal to the costs of production

<br/>

### Profit

When the revenues are greater than the costs of production

<br/>


## Equations 

<br/>

$$BreakEvenPoint = \frac{FixedCosts}{SellingPricePerUnit - VariableCostPerUnit}$$


<br/>


$$BreakEvenPoint = \frac{FixedCost}{ContributionMarginPerUnit}$$


$$TotalRevenue = TotalCosts$$

$$Price \times Quantity = TotalFixedCosts + TotalVariableCosts$$
