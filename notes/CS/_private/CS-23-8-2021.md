## Initialization

This involves generating a random population of individual tours, each of which is a possible solution to the problem. In the traveling salesman problem, with a starting point of X, one possible tour is:

### Bad init

Parents could be 

| parent 1 | parent 2 |
| -------- | -------- |
| 1110     | 1100     |

Initialization bad because there can be overlap bad because could produce same child (1110)





### QUESITONS

Why are there mnutliple types of crossing over
Why are there mulptiple types of Selection
