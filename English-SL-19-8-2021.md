# Is there a standard way for creating commentaries?

## Literary Criticism

 - The reasoned consideration of literary works and issues
 - More strictly construed, the term covers only what has been called "practical criticism", the interpretation of meaning and the judgment of quality
 - Standards of judgment 


## Psycho analytical Tradition

 - BAsed on Freudian theories of psychology
 - Typical areas of focus:
	 - The unconscious, the desires, the defenses
	 - Id (Libido), ego (defenses), superego (judgment)
	 - Oedipus complex


### Some questions that lead to such literary criticism

1. How do the operations of repression structure or inform the work
2. Are there any Oedipal dynamics - or any other family dynamics - at work here?
3. What does the work suggest about the psychological being of its author? 
4. What might be a given interpretation of a literary work suggest about the psychological motives of the reader?
5. Are there prominent words in the piece that could have different or hidden meanings?
