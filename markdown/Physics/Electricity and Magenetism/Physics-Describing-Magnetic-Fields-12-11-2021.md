# Describing Magnetic Fields



We know that 

$$F = BIL$$

## Flux

> More observable property that comes from the field lines is how close together they are, or how many flux lines pass through a particular area. This is known as the **flux density** and is measured in webers per square metre, Wb⋅m−2Wb⋅m−2.


$$Magnetic FieldStrength \equiv Magnetic Flux Density$$


>#### Definition
>**Magnetic flux** is defined as the magnetic field strength normal to a surface multiplied by the area of that surface.



There is a certain amount of flux density per uni area, and therefore 


$$\frac{\phi}{A} = B$$

and furthermore 

$$\phi = BA$$


Since this is normal to a plane at an angle the resultant phi will be differnt

$$\phi = BA\cos{\theta}$$



## Flux Linkage

If we have two loops of wire, the number of times a field line crosses a unit area encircled by wire is doubled.

We can have a coil with N turns, each with an area of A, with the field lines passing through every turn on the coil. The total number of times any field line crosses any single one of these areas is called the **flux linkage**, and is given by

$$FluxLinkage = \phi N$$

$$FluxLinkage = BA\cos{\theta} N$$



> #### Definition
> 
> **Electromotive force**, or emf, is defined as the work done by the power supply per unit charge.



$$\epsilon = -N\frac{\Delta \phi}{\Delta t}$$



> #### Definition
> 
> **Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction** states that the induced emf is proportional to the negative rate of change of magnetic flux linkage through a conducting loop.




$$\epsilon = -NBvl$$


$$\epsilon = -N\frac{\Delta BA}{\Delta t}$$



# Lenz's Law


$$E = IVt$$


>#### Definition
>
> **Lenz's law:** The direction of an induced current is such as to oppose the change that produced it.


$$IV = Fv$$

$$F = Bil$$

$$V = Bvl$$
