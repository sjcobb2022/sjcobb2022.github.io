# Physics - Electric Fields

Vector addition of electric Fields

## Electric Current

$$Q = It$$
$$Q$$ is charge
$$I$$ is amperes
$$t$$ is time


<br><br>


## Drift Velocity

$$v_{d} = \frac{I}{neA}$$

where I is the current
$$v_d$$ is the drift velocity
n is the electron density
e is the charge of an electron
A is the cross sectional area of the wire

$$\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t} = I = nAqv$$


## Electric Potential

When a charge is moved in an electric field, the field does work on the object

$$W = Fd$$

Work done by an external force
 - the work done by an external for in moving positive test charge radially inwards towards a positive charge will be positive because the external for must overcome the mutual repulsion; the potential energy increases
 - THe work done by an external force in moving a negative test charge radially outwards from a positive chge will be positive because the external for must overcome the mutual attraction; the potential energy increases


## Electric Potential vs Electric Potential Energy vs Potential Difference

### Electric Potential

Electric potential energy unit per charge at a particular point in an electric field

$$V = \frac{EPE}{Q}$$
$$V = \frac{W}{Q}$$

### Electric Potential Energy

Energy needed t move a change against an electric field


$$U_{E} = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r}$$

$$EPE = U_{E}$$

### Potential Difference

Difference of electric potentials taken at two different points

$$V_{AtoB} = V_{B} - V_{A}$$

$$V_{AtoB} = \frac{W_{AtoB}}{q}$$

## Equipotential lines

a line along which the electric potential is constant always perpendicular to the electric fields.
