# Charges


$$Q=It$$

$$P=Et$$

$$E = IV$$


> **Definition: Internal resistance**
> the opposition of charges by cells and batteries resulting in the generation of heat




> **Definition: emf**
> electro-motive force; voltage developed by any source of electrical energy.


$$P = I^2r$$

$$V_T = \epsilon - Ir$$

$$\epsilon = I(r + R)$$

Where r is internal resistance and R is external resistance







Resistor = decrease in EPE

Cell = increase in EPE
