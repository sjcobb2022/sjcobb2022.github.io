# Field potential and field strength

$$V_{g} = - \frac{GM}{r}$$

$$g = \frac{GM}{r^2}$$

for earth of a mass $$6*10^{24}$$ and 32000km from earths surface where earth has a radius of 6378km

$$\frac{GM}{r^2} = \frac{6.67 \times 10^{-11} \times 6 \times 10^{24}}{(4.2 \times 10^7)^2} = 0.23 N  kg^{-1}$$


the magnitude of the gradient is therefore 0.23 J/m kg


## Potential energy

$$E_p = \frac{-GMm}{r}$$


### Observations about potential energy
 - Potential energy is negative.
 - The potential energy at infinite separation approaches 0
 - As separation increase between two masses, the potential energy increases although it is negative



## Electric potential

$$E_p = \frac{kQq}{r}$$

### Some more observations
 - Potential energy is negative for attractive forces (opposite charges) and positive for repulsive forces (like charges)
 - The potential energy at infinite separation approaches 0
 - The potential energy increases for opposite charges (attractive force) and decreases for like charges (repulsive force) as the separations increases between two charges




# Satellites, orbits and escape velocity


 
 ORBITS
 
 $$F = \frac{mv^2}{r}$$
 
 $$a = \frac{v^2}{r}$$
 
 | Gravitational                        | Electric                             |
 | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
 | $$\frac{GMm}{r^2} = \frac{mv^2}{r}$$ | $$\frac{kQq}{r^2} = \frac{mv^2}{r}$$ |
 | $$\rightarrow v^2 = \frac{GM}{r}$$   | $$\rightarrow v^2 = \frac{kQq}{mr}$$ |
 | $$v = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}}$$          | $$v = \sqrt{\frac{kQq}{mr}}$$        |






### some simplifications

$$E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \frac{GMm}{2r}$$



$$E_T = E_P + E_K = - \frac{GMm}{r} + \frac{GMm}{2r} = - \frac{GMm}{2r}$$



|                  | sign     | Increasing r | Decreasing r |
| ---------------- | -------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| Kinetic Energy   | Positive | Decrease     | Increase     |
| Potential Energy | Negative | Increase     | Decrease     |
| Total energy     | Negative | Increase     | Decrease     |




given this equation the escape velocity  is


$$v_{esc} = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{r}}$$



## Keppler's Law

$$v = \frac{2 \pi r}{T}$$

$$\frac{2 \pi r}{T} = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}}$$



which solves to 


$$T^2 = (\frac{4 \pi ^2}{GM}) \times r^3$$


which gives the relationship

$$T^2 \propto r^3$$





# The conducting sphere


$$E = \frac{kQ}{e^2}$$


$$ E = 0  $$ if r < R(inside the sphere)

$$E = \frac{kQ}{R^2} $$ if r = R on surface of sphere

$$E = \frac{kQ}{r^2}  $$ if r > R {beyond surface of sphere}





# Parallel plates

$$E = \frac{\Delta V_e}{d}$$





| distance (r) | observed field strength (g) |
| ------------ | --------------------------- |
| $$r$$        | $$g         $$              |
| $$2r     $$  | $$\frac{g}{4}$$             |
| $$8r$$       | $$\frac{g}{64}$$            |





$$F = \frac{kq_1q_2}{r^2} = (kq_1q_2) \times r^{-2}$$


the gradient is equal to $$kq_1q_2$$

and therefore


$$k = \frac{gradient}{q_1q_2}$$




# Class

$$W = Fd \cos{\Theta}$$
