# Physics 

## Electricity and Magnetism


1. What does Electrically neutral mean
2. What is the difference between a positively charged object and a negativly charged object
3. What are the electrons the one migrating and not the other subatomic particles
4. What is the difference between conductors and insulators


### Words
Charge - the property that governs how a particle reacts under an electromagnetic field
Charged Object - object with imbalance of electrons and protons
Uncharged Object - electrically neutral (same amount of protons and neutrons)
POsitive Charge - protons
Negative Charge - electrons
Conductors - materials that promote the free flow of electrons
Insulators - materials the impede the free flow of electrons


<br/><br/>

Two types of charge
Each Charge is Quantised ~ $$1.6*10^{-19}$$
Charges are conserved


<br/><br/>

Friction 
- When insulating materials are rubbed, they may become electrically charged

Conduction 
- Charging by conduction involves the contact of a charged object to a neutral object.

Induction 
-   Induction cooking uses electric currents to directly heat pots and pans through magnetic induction. Instead of using thermal conduction (a gas or electric element transferring heat from a burner to a pot or pan), induction heats the cooking vessel itself almost instantly
