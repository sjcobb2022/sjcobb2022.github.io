# Physics HL Kognity Notes

## Big picture

> **Essential idea:** Electric charges and masses each influence the space around them and that influence can be represented through the concept of fields.

Forces generally fall into two categories: contact forces and non-contact forces. Contact forces are when two bodies need to physically interact and non-contact forces do not need physical contact. The interaction of non-contact forces is generally called "action at a distance".

<br>

The gravitational fields surrounding two masses allows the masses to interact through the gravitational force; the electric field surrounding electric charges allows the interaction of the charges via the Coulomb or electric force. There are similarities and differences between gravitational and electric forces. Some differences include:

-   The gravitational force is always attractive.
-   The electric force is attractive for oppositely-charged particles, and repulsive for like-charged particles.

## Field Strength

| Gravitational Force             | Electric force                  |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| $$F_{g} \propto m_1m_2$$        | $$F_{e} \propto q_1q_2$$        |
| $$F_{g} \propto \frac{1}{r^2}$$ | $$F_{e} \propto \frac{1}{r^2}$$ |
| $$F_g = \frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2}$$   | $$F_g = \frac{kq_1q_2}{r^2}$$   |

| $$F_g = mg$$           | $$F_e = qE$$           |
| $$g = \frac{GM}{r^2}$$ | $$E = \frac{kQ}{r^2}$$ |

## Field potential

Since a particle with mass experiences a gravitational force within a gravitational field, or a charged particle experiences an electric force within an electric field, it is possible for the field to exert a force that does work on the particle. The force within a force field can be described as being a conservative force. By definition this means the force allows the reversible conversion between potential and kinetic energy.

For conservative forces the work done is expressed in terms of the difference in potential energy $$\Delta E_p$$ between two points just like the case of a mass falling through height $$\Delta h$$ in a gravitational field with field strength $$g$$

Work done by a gravitational field

$$W = \Delta E_p = mg \Delta h$$
