# Kirchoff's law


## Junction
A point in a circuit where three or more wires are connected

## Branch
All the wires and components connection one junction to another

## Loop
All the wires and components in a complete circle.

## Kirchhoff's First Law: Current Law

 - Determine where the current flows (Conventional current)
 - If a current enters a junction, it is a "gain" and is assigned as a positive value.
 - If a current leaves a junction it is a "loss" and is assigned as a negative value.

if $$I_1, I_2, I_3 $$ are entering a junction and $$I_4, I_5$$ are leaving


therefore

$$I_1 + I_2 + I_2 = I_4 + I_5$$

## Kirchhoff's Second Law: Voltage Law

### Resistors
- If the loop goes in the direction of the branch current the resistor energy change is negative
- if the loop goes against the branch current the resistor energy charge is positive

### Cells
 - If the lop goes through the cell from negative to positive the cell energy change is positive.
 - If the loop goes through the cell from positive to negative the cell energy change is negative
