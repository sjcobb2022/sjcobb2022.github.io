# Cells, batteries, and internal resistance

>#### Definition
>
>An **electric cell** is a device that is used to generate electricity. Most portable cells are electrochemically-based.
>
>A **primary cell** is designed to be used once and discarded. It cannot be recharged with electricity and reused because the electrochemical reaction in the cell is not reversible. Primary cells are also called dry cells, because the chemicals in them are not liquid.
>
>A **secondary cell** is designed to be charged, used, and recharged with electricity many times. The electrochemical reaction in the cell is reversible.



$$I = \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}$$

$$V = IR \Delta t$$

$$\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}R \Delta t = \Delta Q R$$



>#### Definition
>
>The **internal resistance** of a cell is the electrical resistance of the cell itself, associated with the electrochemical reactions within it.
>
>Internal resistance is modelled as a resistor in series with the cell.
>
>Internal resistance is calculated as:
>
>$$P = I^2 r$$
>
>where P is the power dissipated within the cell in producing a current, I, through the cell internal resistance r.
