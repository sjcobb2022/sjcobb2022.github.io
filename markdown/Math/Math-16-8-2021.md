# Probability
<br/>

## Binomial distribution

 - probability distribution is discrete
 - There are a fixed number of trails
 - There are exactly two outcomes, usually "success" and "failure"
 - The probability of success is the same for all trials, that is, the trials are independent.

X is the binomial distribution where n is the number of trials, o is the probaility of success 

$$P(X = r) = {n \choose r} * p^r * (1-p)^{n-r}$$

Where 

p = probability of event
r = the amount of times we want
n = number of trials


$${n \choose r} = nCr$$

Probability of something happening

$$p(X) = np$$

$$Var(X) = np(1-p)$$

$$sd = \sqrt{Var(X)}$$

| few than number off successes                   | $$P(X) < 5$$                     | $$binomcdf(n,p,4)$$     |
| more than the number of successes               | $$P(X) > 5 = 1- P(X \leq 5)$$    | $$1 - binomcdf(n,p,5)$$ |
| at least a certain number of success            | $$P(X) \geq 5 = 1- P(X \leq 4)$$ | $$1 - binomcdf(n,p,4)$$ |
