# Standard Normal Distribution

### Concept

The standard normal distribution is a good example of how all normal distributions have a certain relationship that allows them to be transformed into the standard form. Recognizing these relationships enables us to generalize  numerous specific distributions into one familiar one that allows us to find probabilities and make comparisons more easily.

### Standardizing the normal distribution

Standard normal variable

$$z = \frac{x-μ}{σ}$$

First, since we want to think in terms of the distance from the mean, we will transform the data using $$x-μ$$ to make the standardized mean 0 . In this way, we convert $$X∼N(μ,σ^2)$$ into$$ X∼N(0,σ^2)$$ Remember that when you transform the data with addition or subtraction, the mean changes but the standard deviation remains the same

meaning that the normal normalized distribution = 

$$P(Z < \frac{x-μ}{σ})$$

>$$X \sim N(3, 0.4^2)$$ 
>$$x=3.5$$
>$$z=\frac{3.5−3}{0.4}=\frac{0.5}{0.4}=1.25$$ Since z is positive, this means that 3.5 is 1.25 standard deviations above the mean.

#### The value of the standard model variable z is how many standard deviations a value is from the mean.



> #### Be aware
>Make sure your answers make sense based on what you know about the normal distribution. Since half of the distribution is above z=0 and half is below z=0 , you can easily determine that in **Example 4** , part (b) must have a probability greater than 0.50.5 and part (c) must be less than 0.50.5 .




#### Making connections

Previously we learned that approximately 68% of the data in a normal distribution falls within one standard deviation, 95% within two standard deviations, and 99.7% within three standard deviations. Using notation for the standard normal distribution, we have:

-   $$P(−1<z<1)≈0.68$$
-   $$P(−2<z<2)≈0.95$$
-   $$P(−3<z<3)≈0.997$$
