# Probability Density function


### Characteristics of probabilities


$$\int^{b}_{a} f(x) dx = 1$$

same is true for 

$$\sum P(x) = 1$$


probabilities sum up to one. 



The probability of  a continueos random variable will be zero because the area under the point is 0



to find the probability that x lies between a and b is the 



$$P(a < X < b) = P(a \leq X \leq b ) = \int()$$


$$mean = E(X) = \int x* f(x) dx$$

$$median = \int^{med}_{-\infty} = 0.5$$

$$mode = f'(x)$$
