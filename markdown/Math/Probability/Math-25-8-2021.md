# Probability: Expectation

Expectation: 

$$E(X) = \sum_{i=0}^{n} x \times P(x)$$

----


For variance: 

$$E(X^2) = \sum_{i=0}^{n} x_i^2 \times P(x_i)$$




$$variance = E(X^2) - E(X)^2$$

----



E(X) is Not a  probability, is therefore doens't not need to be between 0 and 1

a fair game is when E(X) = 0

You could also be given a function to calculate the probabilities instead of a table'
