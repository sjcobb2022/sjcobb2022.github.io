# Input Devices



There are many types of sensors

# Types of Computer systems


## Central Distributed and Embedded systems
### Centralized
 - A central system is on in direct control of the operation of the individual "nodes" and glow of information from a single "server"
 - All the individual nodes are directly dependent on the "server" to send and receive information and to be commanded
	 
### Distributed
 - Unlike a centralized system, which can be ruined by means of destroying a small number of "nodes" at higher up in the hierarchy, a distributed system has no "server"
 - A distributed system does not have to depend on a "server" for the functioning, and all "nodes" in a distributed system are connected on the basis of equality, independence and cooperation.


### Embedded system
 - An embedded system is a computer system with a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electrical system, often with real-time computing constraints
 - It is embedded as part of a complete device of often including hardware and mechanical parts
 - By contrast, a general-purpose computer such as a personal computer, is designed to be flexible and to meet a wide range of end-user needs
 - The key characteristics, however, is being dedicated to hands a particular task, since the embedded system is dedicated to specific tasks, design engineers can optimize it to reduce the size and cost of the product and increase the reliability and performance. 



## Pros and Cons

### Pros of Distributed computing and the Cons of Centralized
 - **Cost**: It is cheaper than running a supercomputer


 - **Performance**: if sufficient computers are connected, performance is far greater than a supercomputer


 - **Reliability**: if one or two computers go offline, it is not going to have a huge effect on the overall processing of information because all the other computers are still online and running the analysis


 - **Scalability**: it is very easy to increase the amount for processing power due to the nature of the software.



### Cons of distributed and pros of centralized
 - **Network bandwidth**: bottle necking can happen if a lot of data is being transferred at once


 - **Security**: if a project has potentially sensitive information inclined it can potentially cause a security branch


 - **Software Complexity**: software has to be written for the project and the software may put people off if it comes across too complicated.
