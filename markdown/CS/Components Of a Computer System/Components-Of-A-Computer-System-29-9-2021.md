# Components Of A Computer System


## Client
 - A piece of hardware or software (although the humans are often also called clients) that accesses a service made available by a server - there are three types of client:
	 - Fat clients
		 - performs the bulk of processing operations itself does not necessarily rely on the server
	 - Thin Clients
		 - rely on the resources of the server (including applications)
	 - Hybrid clients
		 - a mix of either two architectures
 - Clients usually connect to servers or one another creating client-server connections r peer to peer networks

## Server

 - is a combination of software and hardware that processes and delivers data to clients in a network

 - Hardware in a server may vary from server to server based on the purpose of the server - likewise different servers may have different processing powers

## Router
 - is a device that forwards data packets between computer networks - clients connect to a router and any oncoming or outgoing connections are managed but the router

## Firewall
 - is something in a system designed to prevent unauthorized access to or from a  private network.

Firewalls can be implemented in both hardware and software or a combination og both and are used to prevent unauthorized internet users from accessing private networks connected to the internet
