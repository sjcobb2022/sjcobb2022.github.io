#### Trading account

The trading accounts is made by:

>Sales Revenue
>Costs of goods sold 

 - shows the gross profit of the firm:

$$GrossProfit = SalesRevenue - CostsofGoodsSold$$

$$COGS = OpeningStock + Purchases - ClosingStock$$

 - Gross Profit = Sales revenue - costs of goods sold (COGS)
 - COGS = Opening stock + purchases - closing stock
	 - For example if a business opens trading in the morning with $1000 worth of stock and receives a delivery in which it pays $2000 then the business has a costs of stock valued at $3000. At the end of the trading date it has $1800 of stock remaining
	 - COGS = $1000 + $2000 - $1800 = $1200
	 - Assume that the stock sell for 3x their cost, how much is the sales revenue? What is the gross profit?
		- Sales revenue
			- $$1200 \times 3 = 3600$$
		- Gross profit
			- $$3600 - 1200 = 2400$$


#### Profit and Loss (P&L) account

Shows the net profit (or loss) if a business at the end of a trading period.

**The P&L accounts is made from:**
>Gross Profit
>Expenses
>Non-operating income
>
>----
>
>Net profit before interest and tax
>Interest
>Tax


$$NetProfit = GrossProfit - Expenses$$

Expenses are the indirect or fixed costs of product
**e.g.:** salaries, rent, insurance

Interest charges and taxes, despite being expenses, are shown as separate items (because they are beyond the control of the business)

This practice allow the firm to compare like-with-like and enable historical comparisons of financial performance.

**Structure**
>Sales Revenue
>Costs of Goods Sold
>**Gross Profit**
>Less Expenses
>Net profit before interest and tax
>less interest
>net profit before tax
>less tax 
>**Net profit after interest and tax.**


**Example**:
> Sales Revue = 135000
> COGS = 34000
> GROSS profit = 101000
> Less expenses = 16000
> NET PROFIT b4 interest and tax = 85000
> less interest = 7000
> net profit before tax = 78000
> tax = 7800
> Net profit after interest and tax = 70200
