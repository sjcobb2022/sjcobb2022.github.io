## Margin of Safety (MOS)

the margin of safety measures the difference between a firm's sales volume and the quantity needed to break-even. it. it shows the extent to which demand (for a product exceeds the break even quantity

### Equation

$$MOS = LevelOfDemand - Break Even Quantity$$


### example

If the demand of the jeans is 280 given that the break even quantity is 175, then the safety margin is 105 units $$280 - 175$$ or $$(\frac{105}{175}) * 100 = 60 \%$$


**What if its negative**
 - havn't broken even yet


### side notes
you want to see how far away from the break even point you are
