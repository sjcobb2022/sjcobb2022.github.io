# Finance: Depreciation

Decrease of value of a static asset

Value of assets reduce over time.


**Accumulated Depreciation**: accumulation that adds up over time

## What is Depreciation

 - Nearly all fixed/non-current assets will depreciate or decline in value over time
 - Key Principles
	 - annual depreciation attempts to record capital expenditure over the useful life of an asset and avoids recording this expenditure as a one-off cost when the asset is purchased. 
	 - The asset will retain some value on the balance sheet each year until fully depreciated or sold off.
	 - The profit will be reduced by the amount of that year's depreciation and will not be under - or over - recorded
 - Assets decline in value for two main reasons
	 - Normal wear and tear through usage
	 - technological change, making either asset or the product it is used to make, obsolete.

## Calculating Depreciating

### Straight line method

The value of the product decreases in value linearly.  


Every year the same amount is subtracted      



To calculate the annual amount of depreciation you need the following information:
 - the original historical cost of the asset
 - The expected useful life of the asset
 - An estimation of the value of the asset at the end of  its useful life - this is known as the residual value of the asset
 - The following formula is then used to calculate the annual depreciation charge
	 - $$Annual Depreciation Charge = \frac{OriginalCost - ResidualValue}{ExpectedUsefulLife}$$



### Reducing balance method
 - an accelerated depreciation method that records larger depreciation expenses during rhe earluer years of an asset's useful life, and smaller ones in later years
 - $$DepreciationPerYear = NetBookValue \times Rate\%$$
 - 
 - Where
	 - Net book value is the assets net value at the start of an accounting period. it is calculated by deducting the accumulated (total) depreciation from the cost of the fixed asset,
	 - Residual value is the estimated scrap value at the end of the useful life of the asset.
	 - Rate of depreciation is defined according to the estimated pattern of an asset's use over its life term.
