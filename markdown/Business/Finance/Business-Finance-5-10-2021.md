# Balance Sheets

A balance sheet is a financial statement reports a companies assets liabilities and shareholders equity at a specific point in time, and provides a basis of computing rates of return and evaluating its capital structure. It is a financial statement that provides a snapshot of **what a company owns and owes**, as well as the amount invested by shareholders.

## Formula
The balance sheet adhered to the following accounting equation, where assets on once side and liabilities plus shareholders equity on the other

$$Assets = Liabilities + ShareholdersEquity$$

This formula is intuitive: a company has to pay for all the things it owns (assets) by either borrowing money (taking on liabilities) or taking it from investors (issuing shareholders' equity).


## What's on the balance sheet?

Tells you what you own and what you owe.

### Assets

 - Items of monetary value that are owned by a business e.g. cash, stocks and buildings
 - To purchase assets forms need different sources of finance
 - Assets can be classified as a fixed assets or current assets
	 - Fixed assets: lasts for more than 12 months form the balance sheet date
	 - Current assets: refers to cash or liquid assets that are likely to be turned into cash within 12 months of the balance sheet date
		 - **Cash**
		 - **Debtors**
		 - **Stocks** (Inventory)
 - An asset belongs to a business but this doesn't mean that it has been paid for



### Liabilities

 - A liability is a legal obligation of a business to repay its lenders or suppliers at a later data, i.e. the amount of money owed by the business
 - Two main classifications
	 - Long-term liabilities
		 - Due to be repaid after 12 months (long-term borrowing such as mortgages and bank loans)
	 - Current liabilities
		 - debts that must be settled withing 12 months
	 - The value of a firms net assets is therefore the total assets minus its liabilities
		 - $$NetAssets = TotalAssets - Total Liabilities$$



### Equity
 - The value of a business belonging to the owners
 - Two main sections:
	 - Share capital
		 - the amount of money raised through the sale of shares. This is the value raised when the shares were first sold, rather than their current market value
	 - Retained Profit
		 - the amount of net profit after interest. Tax and dividends have been paid. It is reinvested in the business for its own use.
