# Ratios

A quantitative management tool for analyzing and judging performance of a business. 

> ### TIP:
> 
> Don't just simply learn the formulae for the rations without understanding what they actually mean. Focus on why or how the ratios could be used in context of the given business. Address issues such as:
>  - how the business is performing (based on financial data
>  - how the business has performed over time (trends)
>  - What else needs to be considered that is not presented in the data, e.g. business objectives and external constraints n business performance


## Purpose of Ratio Analysis
- To examine a firms financial position, e.g. its short- and long-term liquidity position
- Assess a firms financial performance, e.g. its ability to control expenses
- Compare actual figures with projected or budgeted figures (known as variance analysis)
- Aid decision making. e.g. whether investors should risk their money by investing in the business

Ratios are compared in two ways:
 - **Historical comparisons** involve comparing the same ratio in two different time periods for the same business. Such comparison show trends, thereby helping managers to assess the financial performance of a business over time
 - **Inter-firm comparison** involve comparing the ratios of businesses in the same industry. 

## Profitability and Efficiency Ratios

**Profitability ratios** examine profit in relations to other figures, such as the ratio of profit to sales revenue.

**Efficiency Ratios** show how well a firm's resources have been used, such as the amount of profit generated from the available capital used by the business.


## Profitability Ratios

### Gross Profit Margin

$$GPM = \frac{GrossProfit}{SalesRevenue} \times 100$$

The higher the GPM, the better it is from a business as gross profit goes towards paying its expensive.


### Net Profit Margin

$$NPM = \frac{NetProfit}{SalesRevenue} \times 100$$

A better measurement of a firm's profitability than GPM as its accounts for both costs of goods sold and expenses.

The difference between a firms GPM and NPM represent the expenses. The larger the difference between these two ratios, the more difficult overhead controls tend to be


### Calculating Profitability

| profit and loss accounts for business X | Year 2 | Year 1 | 
| --------------------------------------- | ------ | ------ |
| Sales Revenue                           | 1000   | 850    |
| Costs of goods sold                     | 500    | 450    |
| Net profit before interest and tax      | 400    | 360    |
| tax                                     | 100    | 90     |
| Dividends                               | 50     | 220    |
| retained profits                        | 250    | 50     |



Value of gross profit and expenses
 - year 1
	 - gross profit = 400
	 - expenses = 40
 - year 2
	 - gross profit = 500
	 - costs = 100

calculate GPM and NPM
 - year 1
	 - GPM
		 - $$GPM = 47.05\%$$
	 - NPM
			 - $$NPM = 42.35\%$$
 - year 2
	 - GPM
		 - $$GPM =50\%$$
	 - NPM
			 - $$NPM = 40\%$$


Another factor that could be used to determine the profitability of the company is the depreciation of assets in the company. Depreciation is a factor the company should considers as it determines the amount needed to cover the capital expenditure.
