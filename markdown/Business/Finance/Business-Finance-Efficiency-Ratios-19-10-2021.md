# Business: Efficiency Ratios


## What are Efficiency Ratios?
Show how well a firms resources have been used
 - financial performance of a firm compared with the amount of capital invested
 - amount of time taken by the firm to sell its stock (inventory)
 - Average number of days taken to collect money from debtors




## Return of Capital Employed (ROCE)

<br>

$$ROCE = Net Profit Before Interest And Tax \div Capital Employed$$

<br>

$$Capital Employed = LoanCapital + ShareCapital + AccumulatedRetainedProfit$$

<br>

the amount of money received against the amount of money earned

the amount of return on the money that was initially invested

## Stock Turnover Ratio (STR)

 - Measures the number of times a firm sells its stocks within a time period, usually one year
 - Indicates the speed at which a firm sells and replenishes all its stock
 - Two ways to calculate
	 - $$Stock Turnover = \frac{CostOfGoodsSold}{AverageStock}$$
	 - $$StockTurnover = \frac{Average Stock}{CostOfGoodsSold} \times 365 Days$$
 - Cost of goods sold is used as stocks are valued at cost value rather than selling price


<br>

### What does it mean?

The value of the STR is the amount of times that you replenish your stock.

> **ATTENTION**: A good replenishment rate is dependent on the market.


### Quick example

 - If a business has COGS equal to $100,000 and an average stock level valued at $20,000, then the stock turnover ratio is 5 times a year. 
 - This means that eh business sells all of its inventory, which is then replenished, 5 times a year
 - Using this calculation, the higher ratio the better it is for the firm because more stick is sold and therefore the more efficient it is generating profit.
 - A high stock turnover also means that perishable stock does not expire or stock does not become outdated.



### Improvements
There are several ways that a firm's stock level can be reduced to improve its stock turnover ratio:
 - Holding lower stock levels requires inventories to be replenished more regularly
 - Divestment (disposal) of stocks which are slow to sell. i.e. getting rid of obsolete stock and unpopular products in the form's portfolio
 - Reduce the range of products being stocked by only keeping the best-selling products.


## Debtor Days

 - Measure the number of days it takes a firm, on average, collect money from its debtors
 - Sometimes referred to as the debt collection period
 - Debtors are the customers who have purchased items on trade credit and therefore owe money to the firm
 - It is calculated using the formula
	 - $$DebtorDays = \frac{Debtors}{SalesRevenue} \times 365$$


### Example
 - If a firms debt totals 1 million whilst its sales turnover is 5 million, then the ratio is 73 days to collect debts  from its customers who have bought items on credit


### Why
- The less time it takes for customers to pay their debts, the better it is for the business
	- The business improves its cash flow if the customer pays on time
	- Due to the opportunity cost of holding onto money, the business could invest in this money in other revenue-generating projects
- It is quite common to allow customers 30-60 days trade credit
- Credit control: firm's ability to collect debts within a suitable time frame.


### Improvements
 - Business can improve their debt collection period in several ways
	 - Impose surcharges on late payers
	 - give debtors incentives to pay earlier, such as giving a discount to those who pay their bills before the due date. Many firms encourage their credit customers to use direct debit or autopay.
	 - Refuse any further business with a client until payment is made
	 - Threaten legal action



## Creditor Days

 - measure the number of days it takes on average, for a business to pay its trade creditors
 - Formula for this ratio:
	 - $$CreditorDays = \frac{Creditors}{CostOfGoodsSold} \times 365$$
 - A high creditor days ratio means that repayments are prolonged. This can help free up cash in the business for other use (in the short term).
 - However, a high ratio might also mean that the business is taking too long to pay its creditors so suppliers may impose financial penalties for late payment.


### Example 
If a business has $225,000 owed to its suppliers, with $2million worth of costs of goods solve (COGS), then the creditor days ration is 41

This means that the business takes 41 days on average to pay its suppliers


### Improvement
 The efficiency position of a firm can be enhanced bu improving any of its efficiency ratios. Strategies to improve this include.
 - Developing closer relationships with customers, suppliers and creditors 
 - introduce a system of just-in-time production to eliminate need to hold large amounts of stock
 - Improve credit control. e.g. give customers an incentive to pay earlier

## Gearing Ratio

 - Used to asses a form
 - 's long term liquidity position
 - This is done by examining the firm's capital employed that is financed by long-term debt, such as mortgages and debentures
 - Gearing enable managers to gauge the level of efficiency in the use of a firm's capital structure
 - The formula is 
	 - $$Gearing Ration = \frac{LongTermLiabilities}{Capitalemployed} \times 100$$
	 - or
	 - $$GearingRatio = \frac{Loan Capital}{CapitalEmployed} \times 100$$
 - $$Capital employed = Loan Capital / LongtermLiabilities + ShareCapital + RetainedProfit$$
 - Important for a business not to be over reliant on a loan


### Example
 - a business with long-term liabilities totaling $5million whilst its capital employed is $15 million has a gearing ration of 33.3%
 - This means that 1/3 of the firms sources of finance comes from external interest-bearing sources, whilst the other 2/3 represent internal sources of finance. 


### Details
The higher gearing ration, the larger the form's dependence on long-term sources of borrowing
 - This means the firm incurs higher costs die to debt financing, such as interest repayments to banks
 - This can limit the net profit for the firm


Creditors and investors are interested in the level of gearing of a firm:
 - Helps to assess the level of risk

A firm is said to be **highly geared** if it has a gearing ration of 50% or above.
 - such firms are move vulnerable t increases in interest rates.
 - This situation is similar to an individual who has a large mortgage with a bank.
 - A rise in interest rates will mean such individuals will have higher monthly interest repayments.
 - A highly geared business will be more exposed to interest rate increase or if there is a downturn in the economy as loan repayments remain high, while cash inflow from sales will tend to fall in a recession.

The level of gearing that is acceptable to a business will depend on several factors such as:
 - The size of the business 
 - The level of interest rates
 - Potential profitability.
