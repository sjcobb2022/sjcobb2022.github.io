# Cash Flow

## Difference between cash and profit

Every organisation needs cash in order to keep functioning. 

 - Cash is needed to pay for daily costs such as wages and electricity charges
 - Failure to pay suppliers and utility bulls mat eventually result in a business being declared bankrupt
 - Cash is current asset. it is the money that a business actually receives from the sale of goods and services. 


Profit = Revenues - Costs

 - When a sale is made this contributes towards paying a firms costs
 - When enough products are sold to pat for all costs, the firm reaches its break-even point. Any sales beyond a firm's break even point generate profit for business
 - It is possible for a firm to be profitable but cash deficient. The classic reason is because there is poor credit control (e.g. customers pay on credit, but the firm does not receive cash payment after the credit period.)

### The Working Capital Cycle
 - Cash --> Production costs --> Sales --> Cash
 - Working capital refers to the cash or liquid assets available for the daily running of a business. It shows the funds that are available for a business to pay for its immediate costs and expenditure. 
 - A lack of working capital means that the firm has insufficient cash to fund its routine operations. 


### Working Capital

 - Liquidity refers to how easily an asset can be turned into cash.
 - Evidence from around the world consistently shows that **insufficient working capital** is the **single largest cause of business failure**, rather than lack of profitability. 
 - Inadequate working capital leads to insolvency (a situation where working capital is insufficient to meet current liabilities). This can lead to the collapse of a business. This causes **liquidation** of the firm, i.e. it will need to sell off its assets to repay as much of the money owed to its creditors

## Cash flow forecasts

 - **Cash Inflows** usually come from sales revenue when a customer pays for the products that they have purchased. It can also come from payments made by debtors, loans from a bank, interest received from saving deposits
 - **Cash Outflows** refers to cash that leaves a business. e.g. when invoices or bulls have to be paid.
 - **Net Cash** flow refers to the difference between cash inflows and cash outflows, per time period. Ideally, net cash flow should be positive.

### Reasons for a bank flow forecast
- Bank and other lenders require it to assess the financial health of the business seeking external finance
- Helps managers anticipate and identify periods of potential liquidity problems, i.e. cash efficiency
- Aids in business planning. Good financial control helps a business to better achieve its objectives


### Parts of a Cash flow Forecast

**Opening balance** is the amount of cash at the beginning of a trading period. Notice that the opening balance is the same value has the preceding months closing balance.

**Closing balance** is the amount of cash at the end of the trading period

$$ClosingBalance=OpeningBalance + NetCashFlow$$

### Causes of cash flow problems
 - Overtrading - the situation occurs when a business attempts to expand too quickly (or aggressively), without the sufficient resources to do so. For example, it accepts more orders than it has capacity to handle
 - Over-borrowing - the larger the proportion of capital raised through external sources of finance, the higher the cash outflow on loan interest payments
 - Overstocking - the business holds too much stock
 - Poor credit control - when a business trades for long periods without cash inflows
 - Unforeseen changes - unexpected and erratic changes in demand; production issues.


### Strategies to deal with cash flow problems

#### Decreasing outflows
 - Seek preferential credit terms
 - Seek alternative suppliers
 - Better stock control
 - Reduce expenses
 - Leasing (rather than buying)


#### Increasing inflows
 - Tighter credit control
 - Cash payments only
 - Change pricing policy
 - Improved product portfolio

#### Seek alternative sources of finance
 - Overdrafts
 - Selling fixed assets
 - Debt Factoring
 - Government debentures
