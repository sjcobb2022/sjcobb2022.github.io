**### To what extent does Dimmesdale’s hypocrisy inform his actions in The Scarlet Letter?

  
  

-   Dimmesdale is a symbol of hypocrisy and self-centered intellectualism; he knows what is right but has not the courage to make himself do the public act.
    

  

-   Even though hypocrisy appears to save Dimmesdale from punishment and humiliation, his torment is worse even than Hester's.
    

  
  

His position itself as a clergyman is hypocritical to his deep sin.

  

Arthur Dimmesdale is regarded as a hypocrite since he puts his sin of adultery out of sight and acts as if he were not the adulterer. He cannot admit what he has committed with Hester for seven years.

  

“If Mr. Dimmesdale were really going to die, it was cause enough, that the world was not worthy to be any longer trodden by his feet”

  

“Hester Prynne,” said he, leaning over the balcony, and looking down steadfastly into her eyes, “thou hearest what this good man says, and seest the accountability under which I labor. If thou feelest it to be for thy soul’s peace, and that thy earthly punishment will thereby be made more effectual to salvation, I charge thee to speak out the name of thy fellow-sinner and fellow-sufferer! Be not silent from any mistaken pity and tenderness for him; for, believe me, Hester, though he were to step down from a high place, and stand there beside thee, on thy pedestal of shame, yet better were it so, than to hide a guilty heart through life. What can thy silence do for him, except it tempt him,—yea, compel him, as it were—to add hypocrisy to sin? Heaven hath granted thee an open ignominy, that thereby thou mayest work out an open triumph over the evil within thee, and the sorrow without. Take heed how thou deniest to him—who, perchance, hath not the courage to grasp it for himself—the bitter, but wholesome, cup that is now presented to thy lips!”

  

His hypocrisy causes guilt which then affects his life to be miserable and torturing. 

  
  

Actions 

-   The fact that Dimmesdale hides his own sin while expounding on Hester’s sin, which is actually the same, makes Dimmesdale a hypocrite. Dimmesdale is not only hypocritical to his congregation, but to Hester as well. Dimmesdale commits an act of adultery with Hester.
    
-   His fervent preaching contradicts his own personal sin
    
-   he knows what is right but has not the courage to make himself do the public act.
    
-   More broadly: the puritan culture that he indulges in is hypocritical in of itself; condemning certain sins whilst allowing**
