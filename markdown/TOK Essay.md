# TOK Essay


## Prompt

Can there be knowledge that is independent of culture? Discuss with reference to mathematics and one other area of knowledge.


## Discussion Direction

-   Define culture and independence
-   Are we considering independence as something that is truly separate, with no connection whatsoever, to culture; or is it the idea that there there are some areas of knowledge are merely separate from culture and someone within culture can still find this knowledge
-   1st option begs to question whether such a being could exists
-   Are some areas of knowledge reliant on culture
-   Could you interpret art without culture?
-   Does culture need intersubjectivity - more than one person.
-   Is interaction part of culture?
-   Could an individual create a culture within itself; single person culture.
-   Has own individual perception of the world
-   Culture is a social mechanism?
-   2nd option begs to question the existence of universal knowledge (is there knowledge that is universal, questions to consider: what is beauty? Is maths universal?)
	-   LANGUAGE
	-   As a focus of culture and communication
	-   Can a singular being communicate?
	-   Difference between implicit and explicit knowledge
	-   Mention the assigned AOK (Maths)
	-   The study of maths is somewhat dictated by culture
		-   Mathematics is a way to achieve a goal
			-  Certain areas of maths are certainly driven by culture, but that does not mean that the maths itself is inherently affected by culture.
-   Knowers and the acquisition of knowledge may be dictated by culture however the knowledge itself may be
-   Similar cultures have discovered similar things, it's just the pursuit of that knowledge is dictated by varying cultures. 
-   Are cultures on the path to “discover” knowledge?
	-   E.g. knowledge is intrinsic and therefore all cultures will all find the same knowledge eventually or is knowledge created to meet a demand.
-   Is it that knowledge is created to solve a problem or is it that the same knowledge is discovered by varying cultures that answer the same/similar problem.
	-   Concept:
		-   Is maths merely the tool to describe something or find a solution?
		-   The way of getting to the same solution but of different design? (metaphor could be something like a scissors vs knife or pen vs pencil or headphones vs earbuds or something)
	-   Certain cultures tend towards different methods of solving however the solution is the same.    
-   Is maths just a set of conventions that we use to communicate a conclusion? 
	-  Idea
		-   Optional Theme: Language
	-   There are some things that are universally translatable 
	    -   Things can be communicated via sight?
	-   Same concept as maths
		-   Certain cultures tend towards different methods of solving however the solution is the same.
		-   Same things end up being communicated
	-   Once again, the perception of mathematics is motivated by culture.
-   Next AOK (probably Arts)
	-   Can the arts be detached from the cultural context?
	-   Art cannot be detached.
		-   Art is created by people and people are affected by cultural influences.
	-   Material wise?
		-   Do the materials they use differ from culture to culture
-   Is this due to geographical reasoning or cultural/societal knowledge?    
-   Is it the technological advancements of the culture
-   E.g. materials would be found at the the same time etc. because of the progression of the arts in the said culture
-   Pull back to the perception/creation of knowledge, in this case of materials, is motivated by cultural 
-   Before expression, there needs to be a consideration of the materials at hand
-   Is it the materials that define the methods by which art is expressed
-   Art can be detached
-   Although the way in which art is expressed varies vastly between cultures, there are still some intrinsic similarities.
	-   Universal traits
		-   Song
		-   Dance    
		-   Prose
		-   Painting
	-   Is it in human nature to sing, dance, write prose?
	-   Is that related to biology or is it purely a social construct
	-   Furthermore, is it human nature to be social?
	-   Is creativity biologically determined?
	-   Role of ethics in the development 
    

-   Extra stuff
	-   maths and music
	-   Music theory is so tightly bound to the music that we listen to.
	-   Math, potentially being a form of expression is used to describe phenomena that we may not have understood otherwise
	-   Difference between theoretical and practical; the concept of maths itself is a way to find a solution to a practical problem.
	-   Use of maths to gain a deeper understanding of music further strengthens the connection between the two areas.
	-   AI and art
		-   Does art have a formula?
		-   AI generated art can can create “art” out of nothing basically
		-   What defines art? Is it really art that a computer generates?
	    -   Does computer generated art have any cultural value?
	      

## Main

Introduction

-   Introduce claim and relation to knowledge ← mention knowledge first or something along those lines.
-   Don't need to reference the AOKs yes here
-   Define knowledge and culture    
-   Implications of perspective and subjective opinion on the matter

Body

-   Claim
	-   Math
		-   Certain areas of maths are certainly driven by culture, but that does not mean that the maths itself is inherently affected by culture.
		-   Pascals triangle
	-   Many cultures had similar ideas about this concept at a variety of points in time.
	-   Knowledge is driven by culture in the sense that knowledge is only discovered when necessary 
	-   Calculus was only developed because the cultural and social concepts were to surrounding planets and how they move.
	-   The Egyptians understood the pythagorean theorem for the pyramids (they had 3,4,5 length stick things), before Pythagoras. Knowledge is culturally driven because it is what knowledge is needed at the time.
-   Counterclaim
	-   Math
		-   Is maths just a set of conventions that we use to communicate a conclusion? 
		-   If so, then it relies on communication (Optional theme Language), an essential part of culture.
-   Is language cultural
	-   Is maths a universal language?
		-   Yes, mathematics is a way to communicate reality to a certain extent.
	-   Is maths just a set of conventions that we use to communicate a conclusion?
	-   If so, then mathematical literature is merely the way to express universal thought. 
	-   Probably
	-   Would some lone individual develop language?
		-   Culture is a social mechanism?
-   Claim
-   Art
-   Art is created by people and people are affected by cultural influences.
	-   Art is inherently cultural because it is made by people
	-   People are inherently cultural beings    
	-   Therefore art is inherently cultural.
	-   Reiterate point on communication as a social mechanism
	-   Art itself is a manner for communication and expression
	-   Introduces the subjectivity of human nature and the culturally affected experiences of the artist. 
-   Counterclaim
-   Art
	-   Although the way in which art is expressed varies vastly between cultures, there are still some intrinsic similarities.
	-  There has to be some intrinsic, maybe even biological part of us that causes us to react to music universally no matter race, culture etc. 
		- Art does vary between cultures and that is very similar, but the intrinsic quality of the art itself, a form of expression, seems like an objectively universal truth and form of expression.
	-   Most cultures have song, dance, prose and painting.
		-  Although there may be cultural variation in the art itself, the knowledge of the knowledge in this area may not determine the 


Conclusion: 
Certain areas of maths are certainly driven by culture, but that does not mean that the maths itself is inherently affected by culture.

-   Reiterate this point
-   Is this the nature of mathematics?

Say that assumptions were made based on introduction: e.g. all assumptions made of the definitions of “independence” and “culture”.

Really depends on the knowers perspective on culture and independence.

Questions to leave with:
-   Is the common presence of art a reflection of some sort of “biological” necessity?
-   Is mathematics just an expression of understanding or is there some definitive “solution”?
-   At what point does the application of mathematics verge on becoming a cultural action?
    


## Can there be knowledge that is independent of culture? Discuss with reference to mathematics and one other area of knowledge.


### Intro

  

Some may argue that 

  

to determine whether there can be knowledge that is independent of culture, 

  
  

Knowledge and culture have a complex convoluted relationship which is rooted in the knowers own personal context. Determining whether knowledge and culture are independent would be to question the very nature of knowledge, culture and independence themselves. The extent to which knowledge and culture are independent vary greatly on the definition and the frame of reference that is used. Knowledge could be regarded as totally self-contained or merely as a separation between certain cultural and non-cultural aspects.

Considering the total separation from culture most likely means separation from the societies that culture so fervently depends on. 

Considering 

The total separation of knowledge from culture 

To truly separate knowledge and culture, the 

To truly separate knowledge from culture, there must also be a separation from the societies that culture so fervently depends on. One must first consider however, whether it is the human condition to innately have an individual perception of knowledge. 


Humans, as emotional beings, 

If we are to consider independence in the sense of total separation of knowledge and culture, 

Considering knowledge in isolation from culture puts into question the 

The separation from culture most likely means the separation from the society that culture so fervently depends on. The removal of some being from it's culture 

Knowledge, without culture is - if anything - a way to communicate logic and reason.

Conversely, independence could be examined in the sense that there are certain types of knowledge that transcend culture in the sense that some knowledge is present regardless of culture.  Mathematics is a strong proponent of this theory, as many similar mathematical concepts are solved independent of one another in various cultures. Pascal's triangle for example - named after the baroque period, French mathematician {Blaise Pascal} - was used by the Egyptians thousands of years prior. Such a distinct similarity implores one to reflect on the seemingly transcendent characteristics that knowledge exhibits. 



Is it that knowledge is created to solve a problem or is it that the same knowledge is discovered by varying cultures that answer the same/similar problem.

If anything, attaining the same knowledge in such distinct and separate cultures 

In this case, knowledge is something that is always "present" and merely is merely discovered by humans to answer some problem that needs and answer. It is almost an intrinsic human trait to seek out knowledge and to explore areas that may not have been explored before. The 

Although the process of discovery is dictated by culture, one might argue that knowledge itself is 




the pursuit of knowledge 



---societal motivation
  

Such a similarity brings into context the

universal?? <-- could just be in reference to humans??? 

e.g. human biology leads to some sort of solution that other beings would not.
