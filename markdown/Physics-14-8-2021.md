## Essential Ideas when charges move, electric current is created

-   What are charges?
-   Are there different kinds of charge?
-   Where are they found? Can we see them? Can we create them?
-   How do they exert forces? How strong are these forces? How can the forces move objects?

Charge is a property of elementary particles that make up everything else, including nucleus, atoms, molecules and so on.

Two charged objects produce and electrical force that depends on the product of their charge.

electrical force is very strong (10^36 times stronger than gravitational forces)

Experiments in 1909 by the American physicist Robert Millikan to measure the charge on the electron showed that it could only have a charge of $$1.6*10^{-19}C$$ and that all charges in nature are multiples of that value (free-standing quarks excluded). This is the elementary charge unit for both electrons and protons and is provided in the IB Physics data booklet.

# Defining electric charge, force, and field

## Electric Force

#### How can we calculate force between electric charges?

The Coulomb (C) the unit of electric charge.


$$F \approx \frac{1}{d^{2}}$$

at 10cm
$$F \approx \frac{1}{10^{2}} = \frac{1}{100}$$


$$\frac{F}{2} \approx \frac{1}{({\sqrt[2]{2} * 10})^2} = \frac{1}{200}$$

While Coulomb understood very well the nature of the relationship between the electrostatic force and the product of the charges and distance separating their centers, he, similar to Newton, was not the one to experimentally or theoretically determine the constant, k, within the law. It would require the work of Gauss and Maxwell to theoretically determine the value. Coulomb's constant is equal to:

$$k = \frac{1}{4 * \pi * ε_0}$$


where $$ε = \frac{1}{η_0 * c^{2}}$$

where c is the speed of light and $$η_0$$ is the vacuum permeability


<br/>

The total electric force on a system is $$F_{electric} \propto q_1*q_2$$

<br/>


> #### Definition
>**Coulomb's law** states: The magnitude of the electrostatic force of attraction or repulsion between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of the magnitudes of charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.
>
>In symbols:
>
>$$F_{electric}=k* (\frac{q_1*q_2}{r^2})$$,
>
>Here, q1q1 and q2q2 are the magnitudes of the charges, r is their separation, and k is a constant.
>
>Positive or negative charge values are included with physical values and calculated according to the usual mathematical rules. A positive value of the electric force is repulsive, and a negative force is attractive; both forces act along a line joining the point sources.


The constant k determines the force unit from the unit of charge during calculations, and k also depends on the material between the objects. In the SI system of units, charge is measured in coulombs, C.

<br/>


>#### Definition
>
>All materials have an **electrical permittivity** that is a measure of the resistance offered by the substance in creating an electric field within it and affects the transmission of the electrical force. A material that is easily polarised has a high permittivity. The SI unit for permittivity is farad⋅m−1farad⋅m−1.

<br/>
<br/>



The precise definition of electrical force which now includes the inverse square variation is now

$$F_{electric} = \frac{q_1  q_2}{4  \pi ε_0  r^2}$$

Therefore k is

$$k = \frac{1}{4 \pi ε_0}$$

>### *Example 1*

> <br>
><details><summary>Answer</summary> Diagram B. The force exerted by the charge in the upper left corner will be repulsive and point directly to the right. The force exerted by the charge in the lower right corner will be attractive and point directly down. The sum of these two forces would look something like option A. However, the force exerted by the charge in the lower left corner will be repulsive and point directly at a 45 degree angle upward and to the right, but it is not as large as the other two forces (the charge in the lower left is farther away). Adding this (smaller) force to the sum of the other two will produce a force that most closely resembles option B.</details>




>### Example 2
>
>A point charge A of $$2.55×10^{−6}C$$ is separated by $$0.750m$$ from a point charge B of $$−3.00×10^{−5C}$$.
>
>1.  Determine the force exerted by point charge A on point charge B.
>2.  Determine the force exerted by point charge B on point charge A.
>

Answer:
1. We apply the Coulomb's law formula for the force between two charges $$q = -3 * 10^{-5} C$$ is seperated over a distance of $$r = 0.75m$$

   $$F_{electric A on B} = \frac{q_1  q_2}{4  \pi ε_0  r^2}$$

   $$F_{electric A on B} = 8.99 *10^{9}Nm^{2}C^{2} * \frac{2.55*10^{-6}C * -3*10^{-5}C}{0.75^{2}} = -1.22$$

   The negative sign arises because one of the charges is negative and it indicates that the force between the charges is attractive along the line joining the charges.

2. According to Newton's third law,  $$F_{electric B on A}=−F_{electric A on B}$$. The force remains attractive (it is negative) but, from Newton's third law, opposite in direction to the calculated value in part 1.

## Electric Fields

>#### Definition

>An **electric field** is a [vector field](https://app.kognity.com/study/app/physics-hl-2016/measurement-uncertainties/vectors-scalars/defining-scalars-vectors) that associates to each point in space the Coulomb force that would be experienced per unit of electric charge, by an infinitesimal test charge at that point.
>
>The **electric field strength** is the magnitude of the force per unit charge on an infinitesimal positive test charge placed in the field.
>
>In symbols:

## Questions

>An electron is placed just above the surface of the Earth. In which direction (**upwards** or **downwards**) must an electric field be applied to keep the electron stationary?
>
>Answer: **downwards**
>Explanation: The weight of the electron is acting downwards, so the force on the electron due to the electric field must be acting upwards. However, the direction of an electric field is defined as the direction a positive charge would move, and an electron is negatively charged. So the electron moves against the electric field, which must therefore be acting downwards.

> <br/>
> A spark transfers a charge between the plates. If the right-hand plate now has a charge of $$−0.2mC$$, what is the magnitude of the charge difference between the two plates? Give your answer in mC with a unit.
>Answer: 2.2mC
>Explanation: If the charge on the right-hand plate has been reduced from $$−1.0mC$$ to $$−0.2mC$$, charge of $$0.8mC$$ must have been transferred. Charge is always conserved, so if $$0.8mC$$ of negative charge was lost by the right-hand plate, the same magnitude of negative charge must have been gained by the left-hand plate, reducing the charge on the left-hand plate to $$2.0mC$$. The charge difference is therefore:
> $$2.0−(−0.2)=2.2 mC$$

# Charges and work - electric potential

Recall that potential energy is energy that results from position or configuration. When a charged object is moved in an electric field, the field does work on the object. Work changes the potential energy of the object.

<br/><br/>

Work done by an external force:

-   The work done by an external force in moving a positive test charge radially inwards toward a positive charge will be positive because the external force must overcome the mutual repulsion; the potential energy increases.
-   The work done by an external force in moving a negative test charge radially outwards from a positive charge will be positive because the external force must overcome the mutual attraction; the potential energy increases.

## Electric Potential
<br/>
>#### Definition
>**Electric potential**, V, is defined as the electrical potential energy per unit charge at a particular point in an electric field.
>
>The electric potential has a value of $$V=Wq$$, where W is the work done by some force external to the field to bring a small test charge q from infinity to a particular point in an electric field.
>
>By this definition electric potential is zero at infinity.
>
>Electric potential is a scalar, and all points in an electric field have an electric potential. Each point has only one scalar value for electric potential.


<br/>

If the external force does negative work then it is a restraining force where either:
-   a negative test charge has moved to a point of positive potential
-   or a positive test charge has moved to a point of negative potential.


The unit for electrical potential is the volt $$joule⋅coulomb^{−1}=J⋅C^{−1}=volt=V$$. We could say that a Volt is the the amount of energy per unit Coulomb

<br/>

>#### Definition
>
>**Potential difference** is the difference of electric potentials taken at two different points. 
>
>When an external agent does work WA to BWA to B in taking a test charge q from point A, to point B, the potential difference is:
>
>$$V_{Ato B}=VB−VA=\frac{W_{A to B}}{q}$$
>
>When VA to B=0VA to B=0 we call the points equipotentials. No work is done in moving between equipotentials.


Whenever VB>VA the external force does positive work when moving a positive test charge. Because the electric field is conservative the work done does not depend on the path; only on the potential at the start and end points.

>#### Be aware
>
>Sometimes **voltage** is used instead of **potential difference**, but potential difference more accurately represents the concept of potential energy per unit charge.


<br/><br/>


## Another unit for energy: the electron-volt

The electron is known to possess the smallest quantity of charge, and this charge is negative. All charged objects have a charge value that is a multiple of the charge on the electron. This is a result of a deficit or surplus of electrons, each carrying an identical fundamental charge. The symbol for, and the fundamental magnitude of, the electron charge is $$e=1.60×10^{-19}C$$



>#### Definition
>The **electron-volt** ( eV ) is the amount of energy needed to move an electron through a potential difference of one volt.

$$ 1eV = charge × 1V  = e×1J⋅C*{−1} = 1.60×10^{−19}C×1J⋅C^{−1}=1.60×10^{−19}J$$
