Create an outline for your essay (please do not start without this), with each part focusing on the following: 

a. Introduction. Important elements here will include your chosen question, your thesis statement (which is your one-sentence response to the question), and a brief overview of what your chosen works are and how they are meant to support your thesis statement. 

b. Body. Within the body of the essay, work on discussing a maximum of three points. Here, you will need to make sure that you identify and comment on the specific authorial choices that support your points, such as literary devices. It is here that you will be expected to include and seamlessly weave in the most relevant quotes from the text, using them as further evidence, and explain how their mention backs up your argument. 

Please note that relevance is based not on length, but content, and how impactful your chosen quotes are. This is where much of your marks in Criterion A and B are derived. If your quotes are unnecessarily long or are derived from the same chapters repeatedly (especially if they come from the first few chapters), or if you are vague about the terms you use for authorial choices, they will lower your marks significantly. You are expected to exhibit a broad and deep understanding of the texts you have chosen, so using such evidence as had been described belies that. 

c. Conclusion. Reiterate your thesis statement and your points in relation to it. Rephrase your evidence to strongly show that your argument is cohesive and coherent. This cohesion and organization of thought is where your marks for Criterion C and D typically come, and while it clearly will not be based solely on your conclusion, your ability to tie your points up clearly here will be a good indicator if you were able to do so in the rest of the essay. 

(4) Write your essay out in continuous format, setting it at 1000 words maximum. Note that when I say maximum, I do not mean for you to try and reach it – it is just the number of words that you have at the most. Instead of a goal, think of it as a parameter: just a line that you are asked not to cross. Please make sure to write your total word count at the end of the essay.




**Introduction**

Literary pieces are merely a reflection of the author's psyche; a vessel of experiences, psyche, emotions and feelings that the author bestows on their readers. In their own right, The Scarlet Letter and Animal farm reflect reality in their own distinctive ways; primarily as a form of critique of political or religious perspectives (in regards to Animal Farm and The Scarlet Letter respectively). Through the use of satire, political allegory, and irony both pieces are able to succinctly represent individuals from their corresponding time periods through the transformation of characters.

**Body**

Transformation in The Scarlet Letter is 



The Scarlet Letter's focus on puritanism and the church pivots strongly around Nathaniel Hawthorn's own unfavourable outlook on puritan society.

 - Rebellious --> once again submissive under the rile of the pigs


- The Puritans left the Old World because they wanted to "purify" the Church of England. Their chief complaints were that the services should be simpler and that religion should contain an intense spiritual relationship between the individual and God.

 - irony that he had seen it all before yet he still couldn't do anything. 

That man who Hester loves so deeply, Mr. Dimmesdale also undergoes major changes due the sin he bears. In the beginning of the book we see this man&#8217;s weakness and unwillingness to confess sin even as he begs Hester the person he committed his sin with to come forth with her other parties name (p56). As The Scarlet Letter progresses we see Dimmesdale become weaker physically and his religious speeches become even stronger so that his congregation begins to revere him. For a large part of the novel Dimmesdale has been on a downward spiral in terms of mental and physical health thanks to a so-called friend who was issued to take care of Mr. Dimmesdale, then because of a talk with Hester he is revitalized and given the power to do something, which he could not for seven long years. At the end of the novel Dimmesdale is finally able to recognize his family in public and confess his sin before all releasing the sin he held so long hidden in his heart 
 - Satire
	 -   hiding behind spirituality almost
	 - Dimmesdale is a **symbol of hypocrisy and self-centered intellectualism**; he knows what is right but has not the courage to make himself do the public act.
		 - THEY STILL REALLY LIKE HIM <-- Irony
		 - SOMETHING THAT HAWTHORN FELT WAS VERY PREVALENT 

CHILLINGOWORTH
 - He has now changed from **a human being into a vengeful fiend**, a mortal man who has lost his “human heart.” Saying that she bears the blame for Chillingworth's tragic transformation, Hester begs him to relent in his revenge and become a human being again.
 - Chillingworth insists that his revenge and Hester’s silence are “their fate.” “Let the black flower blossom as it may!” he exclaims to her. “Now go thy ways, and deal as thou wilt with yonder man.”
 - Because of his layers and depth, Chillingworth can be viewed as one of the more interesting characters in the novel. What was once a kind hearted scholar has now become a descendent of the devil himself. This is how powerful the realms of jealousy and vengeance can bring upon someone.
 - Representation of puritan societies wrath.
	 - the general concensus and pure hatred and extent that puritan society would go to condemn and avenge whilst still remaining 
- Chillingworth becomes a malevolent _hypocrite_ as he feigns friendship for Reverend Dimmesdale while enacting a plan of revenge filled with hate

HESTER TRANSFORMATION
 - Main transformation 
	 - away from guilt
		 - representation of removal from the church
		 - freedom from a construct that hawthorn thought toxic?
	- 
	- Feeble into strong
		- throwing away the social stigmatisation
			- encouraging others to do the same
			- Puritans left England for the New World to escape persecution and judgement in the hands of others in power.
				- **really escaping to the new world**
				- the new world is just as bad as it was before, there isnt any change <-- irony





Irony: Scarlett letter


**Conclusion**















After Dark

Transformation:

Eri: Because Eri's identity was so invested in the TV show, **she decided to go to sleep to get away from everyone's crushing expectations of her**. Mari was also a source of jealousy for Eri because Mari had the freedom to develop her own interests and identity

As her room suggests, Eri does not have much of an identity, which could easily be interpreted as a spiritual issue. While Mari discusses how she sometimes feels inferior to her sister, Takahashi notes that Eri also feels somewhat jealous of Mari:

In essence, Eri is the best example of how the text uses light as a symbol for consumer culture and the dire, spiritual consequences its expectations inflict upon people. This is a direct reversal of light’s traditional role of being a symbol for enlightenment. Eri is said to have a certain “radiance” to her, as Takahashi notes. However, she constantly lends her radiance not to the development of her own self, but to the glitz and glamor of modern consumer culture.

--> Post-developmental stages
e.g. 
She doesn't transform in the book, more from the discussions of Mari and Takahashi.
 - from the "perfect" model into deep depression.

Mari: coming out of herself; the lonely life of young adults. Mari’s feelings of rejection and social isolation

In essence, this contrast serves as a physical marker delineating those that inhabit this intimate, more communal world of darkness, from those, such as Mari and Shirakawa, who are part of the more “respectable” and, in a way, distracted and alienated society of Tokyo during the day.

Mari’s fashion sense also seems subdued. The most unique aspect of her clothing is probably her Boston Red Sox cap and her varsity jacket. The reader receives no impression that she is actually a fan of the Boston Red Sox. 
 - subdued like her.
 - urging for connection
	 - Mari is subconsciously trying to get to “After Dark” so that she can connect with her sister, as she later realises.
- Needless to say, the text does not suggest that Mari’s choice of clothing and appearance are the only thing delineating her from this social level of the world of darkness. For example, Kaoru asks “…what’s a girl like you doing hanging out all night in a place like this?” while Mari joins her for drinks at the local bar (page 57).  This comment works perfectly on a thematic level: In a sense, Mari has traveled to a completely different world from the one she normally inhabits. She comes from the world of day and light. A world full of appearances and expectations that can become so oppressive that they almost invade one’s soul.

In all, these encounters serve to bring Mari closer to finding human connection. None of these experiences would have happened or even had the same effect on her had she not entered Tokyo after dark. In this way, the darkness works on a social level to bring the main character in contact with people from different social classes and backgrounds. This helps her to find human connection, which in turn allows her to connect on an almost metaphysical level with her sister.

Essentially, the text is showing what this means for Mari: She is taking the plunge into the communal world that exists after dark. To stress this point, the room slowly darkens after she leaves her reflection in the mirror, “Her somber gaze seeming to be expecting some kind of occurrence” (page 67). This could be interpreted as her leaving behind her old, isolated, daylight self in the bright Skylark.
