## Pricing Strategies

### Market Skimming
 - Used for technological advances and products
 - Since new products development can be vert expensive, a high price is initially set to recoup the costs of research and development
 - A high initial price can also create a unique and prestigious image for the product
 - Game consoles, smartphones and flat screen televisions have all be priced using this strategy
 - Due to the large potential profits that can be made other firms will eventually be attracted to enter the industry, when this happened the original firm will gradually reduce its price
 - Market skimming can only be successful if it is supported bu other elements of the marketing mix

### Penetration Pricing
 - Penetration pricing sets a relatively low price for a special introductory price to help establish a new product in the industry
 - As the product is established, the price can be raised.
 - This strategy is suitable for mass market products sold in large enough quantities to sustain low profit margins. e.g. fast moving consumer goods
 - Potential problems: setting prices too low can cause customers to perceive the product as inferior and of poor quality.
 - Companies who do this can afford it. They just want to gain market share/customers from other brands.
 - Example
	 - Brilliance Automobiles launched care around 15% lower than other Korean and Japanese brands. 
----

### Competitive Pricing
 - In many markets the level of competition is very high and firms selling in these markets will often charge similar prices to each other
 - Competitive pricing is used for pricing both new and existing products
	 - If a business has a good brand image and loyal customers, it can use competitive pricing to launch a new product that's similar to those in the market

### Price Leadership
More of a behavior than a actual scheme

 - A strategy often used for the best-selling products or brands in a particular market
 - Competitors then follow the leader by selling their prices based n the price of the market or the price leader
 - if a market leader sets a relatively high price, firms in the industry will enjoy higher profit margins
 - However if the dominant forms set a low price, this can create problems for other firms that are unable to match the price as they do not have the same economies of scale as the market leader.

Better for larger companies to price lower??? (weed out the competitors)

----

### Promotional Pricing
 - Set the pricing as low as possible for a limited period to get consumers to buy

----

### Loss Leader
 - involves setting a product below its cost value
 - retailers such as supermarkets often use this strategy y heavily marketing the loss leader such as toilet tissue or carbonated drinks in the hope of attracting customers
 - Can be used to encourage brand switching
 - The aim is to recoup the loss by sales of complementary goods.
 - Cannot set price too far from the leader otherwise you will lose market share/profit

----

### Cost-Plus
 - involves adding a percentage of predetermined amount of profit to the cost per unit of output to determine the selling price
 - the percentage or specific amount is known as the mark-up or profit margin
 - Advantage: simplicity and ease of calculation
 - Disadvantage: relies too much on intuitive decision-making rather than the needs of the customers

----
### Psychological Pricing
 - putting .99 onto the end of everything
 - Make it look cheaper than it is. (price at 199.99 instead of 200)
 - Makes the customer feel better about the purchase
	 - Think they saved money
 - Could also be constantly keeping something "on sale" but selling it at it's base price
